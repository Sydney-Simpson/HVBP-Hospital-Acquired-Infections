# Background

Data was retrieved from [Data.CMS.gov](https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/77hc-ibv8#data-table),  a website which hosts public data released by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). Archived data snapshots from 2024, 2023 and 2022 were downloaded as separate data tables and contained information from 2023, 2022, and 2021 respectively.

Hospital Acquired Infections are a major public health concern, and can occur from a variety of devices, surgeries, procedures, or be passed from patient to patient. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collect data on infections that occur while patients are in the hospital through the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN).
